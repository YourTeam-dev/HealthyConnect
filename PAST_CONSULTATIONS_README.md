# Enhanced Past Consultations System

## Overview
The Past Consultations system has been enhanced to show more realistic and comprehensive consultation data from the backend seed data, replacing the previous mock data approach.

## What's New

### Backend Enhancements
- **Increased Data Volume**: Now generates 100 appointments instead of 35
- **Realistic Past Consultations**: 70% of appointments are past consultations (COMPLETED/CANCELLED)
- **Enhanced Medical Details**: Each consultation now includes:
  - Realistic symptoms based on consultation reason
  - Medical diagnosis
  - Prescriptions
  - Follow-up dates
  - Specialization-based costs
  - Dynamic consultation durations

### Frontend Improvements
- **Better Pagination**: Shows 25 consultations per page (increased from 20)
- **Enhanced UI**: Added consultation statistics dashboard
- **Improved Data Display**: Better handling of consultation details
- **Load More Functionality**: Efficient pagination for large datasets

## How to Use

### 1. Populate Database with Seed Data
```bash
cd Backend
npm run seed
```

This will create:
- 100 appointments (70 past, 30 future)
- Realistic medical consultation data
- Enhanced consultation details

### 2. Access Past Consultations
The frontend will automatically fetch past consultations from the backend, showing:
- Total consultation count
- Breakdown by status (Completed/Cancelled)
- Breakdown by type (Video/Text)
- Detailed consultation information

### 3. Features Available
- **Filtering**: By consultation status (All, Completed, Cancelled)
- **Expandable Cards**: Click "Show More" to see full details
- **PDF Download**: Generate consultation reports
- **Recording Download**: For video consultations with recordings
- **Pagination**: Load more consultations as needed

## Data Structure

Each consultation includes:
```typescript
interface UIConsultation {
  id: number;
  doctorName: string;
  doctorSpecialization: string;
  consultationDate: string;
  consultationType: 'TEXT' | 'VIDEO';
