# Video Tutorial Testing Guide

## How to Test the Video Section

### Current Status
The video section now automatically detects whether a video file exists and shows the appropriate content.

### What You'll See Now:
1. **Status Indicator**: Shows "⏳ Video Coming Soon" or "✅ Video Available"
2. **Smart Button**: Changes text based on video availability
3. **Automatic Detection**: Checks for video file on page load
4. **Proper Fallback**: Shows placeholder when no video is available

### To Test the Video Functionality:

#### Option 1: Add a Real Video File
1. Create a video file named `healthconnect-tutorial.mp4`
2. Place it in the `frontend/public/` folder
3. Refresh the page
4. The video player will automatically appear

#### Option 2: Test with a Sample Video
1. Download any short MP4 video file
2. Rename it to `healthconnect-tutorial.mp4`
3. Place it in the `frontend/public/` folder
4. Refresh the page

#### Option 3: Test the Placeholder (Current State)
- The page currently shows the placeholder because no video file exists
- This is the expected behavior
- The placeholder includes helpful information and action buttons

### File Structure:
```
frontend/
├── public/
│   ├── healthconnect-tutorial.mp4    ← Add your video here
│   ├── video-thumbnail.jpg           ← Optional thumbnail
│   └── README_VIDEO.md               ← This file
└── src/
    └── layout/
        └── LandingLayout/
            └── HowItWorks.tsx        ← Updated component
```

### How It Works:
1. **Page Load**: Automatically checks if `/healthconnect-tutorial.mp4` exists
2. **Video Available**: Shows video player, hides placeholder
3. **Video Not Available**: Shows placeholder, hides video player
4. **Smart Button**: Changes behavior based on video availability
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing files

### Testing Steps:
1. Open the "How It Works" page
2. You should see "⏳ Video Coming Soon" status
3. The placeholder should be visible with instructions
4. Click "Learn How to Add Video" to scroll to instructions
5. Add a video file and refresh to see it work

The video section is now fully functional and will automatically work once you add your tutorial video!
